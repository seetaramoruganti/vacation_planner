1. in this project, we discussed the effects of not using use effect which leads to infinite rendering of components example the app component runs every time when the location is fetched

2. implemented localStorage for places selected, and pending - should also impleement for the pplaces removed from selected places the storeage should be updated if removed.
3. useEffect clean up function and its uses while using timer for modal
4. use of useCallback hook to avoid infinte looping of component while using useEffect with function as dependencies
